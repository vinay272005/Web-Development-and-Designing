              <h2>Why I Admire Him</h2>
              <p>
                Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was not just a brilliant scientist and the 11th President of India, he was a man of humility, vision, and simplicity.
                His contributions to space and missile programs made India proud. But more than his achievements, it was his love for youth and his inspiring
                words that made a lasting impact on me. He taught us to dream big, work hard, and remain grounded.

              <h2>Life & Legacy</h2>
              <p>
                Born into a humble family in Rameswaram, Kalam worked his way up through dedication and perseverance.
                He played a key role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests and was awarded the Bharat Ratna for his service to the nation.
                He spent his later years teaching, mentoring, and motivating students across India. Even in his final moments, he was delivering a lecture —
                a true testament to his commitment to education.

              <h2>My Takeaway</h2>
              <p>
                What I admire most is his belief in the power of youth and education. He once said, "Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action."
                These words continue to fuel my passion and remind me that with hard work and integrity, anything is possible.
